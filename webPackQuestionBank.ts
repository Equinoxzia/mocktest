'ts-loader' directly compiles TypeScript, while 'babel-loader' with TypeScript presets can also handle TypeScript. For example, configuring `{ test: /.ts$/, use: 'ts-loader', exclude: /node_modules/ }` allows Webpack to process TypeScript files.",

      "It manages environment variables",
    ],
    answer: "It controls the generation of source maps for debugging",
    explanation:
      "'devtool' configuration option controls the generation of source maps, which help in debugging by mapping the compiled code back to the original source. For example, setting `devtool: 'source-map'` generates a full source map file, making it easier to debug the code.",

    answer:
      "By using 'file-loader' or 'url-loader' to process and include SVG files",
    explanation:
      "To handle SVG files in Webpack, you use 'file-loader' or 'url-loader' to process and include them in the build. 'file-loader' emits the SVG files to the output directory and returns their URLs, while 'url-loader' can inline the SVG files as base64 data if they are small enough. For example, configuring `{ test: /.svg$/, use: 'file-loader' }` will handle SVG files appropriately.",
